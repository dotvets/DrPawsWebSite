I want to create a website for veterinary clinics, and I will now attach the brand guidelines that I want the homepage to match exactly.
For now, I only want to create the Home page (main landing page), and its content is as follows:

Appointment Section Content (directions are written in red for clarification)

Hero Section / Slider

Headline: Dr. Paws Veterinary Clinic

Subheadline: Compassionate Care for Your Beloved Pets

Subtext: Providing the Highest Quality Veterinary Care
