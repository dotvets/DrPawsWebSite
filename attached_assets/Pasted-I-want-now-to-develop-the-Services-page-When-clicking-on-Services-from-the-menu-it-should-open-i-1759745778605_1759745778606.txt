I want now to develop the Services page. When clicking on “Services” from the menu, it should open in a new route, similar to the About page.

The page should include a modern animated header image (similar to Home and About pages) and display the following content, clearly structured by sections and service categories.

Section: Introduction

1. Periodic Medical Examinations

At Dr. Paws, we believe preventative care is essential for a long and healthy life for all pets. Our periodic pet examinations, also known as wellness exams or checkups, are a crucial part of our comprehensive veterinary services.
They allow our veterinarians to assess your pet's overall health, detect potential problems early, and provide personalized recommendations.

Canine Examinations: Vital signs, cardiopulmonary auscultation, ophthalmologic, otoscopic, oral, dermatological, abdominal, and musculoskeletal evaluations.
Feline Examinations: Gentle checkups covering vital signs, eyes, ears, oral health, abdomen, coat, and skin.

Design Notes:

Each service section should be visually separated with headers and spacing.

Add a top animated image banner related to veterinary care (e.g., pets with doctors, clinic background).

Ensure responsive design and Arabic translation compatibility (RTL).
