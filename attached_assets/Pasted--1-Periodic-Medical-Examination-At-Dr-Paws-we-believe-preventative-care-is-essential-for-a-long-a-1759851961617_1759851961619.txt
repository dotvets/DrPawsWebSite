#1 Periodic Medical Examination
At Dr. Paws, we believe preventative care is essential for a long and
healthy life for all pets. Our periodic pet examinations, also known as
wellness exams or checkups, are a crucial part of our comprehensive
veterinary services. These routine visits allow our veterinarians to
assess your pet's overall health, detect potential problems early, and
provide personalized recommendations for their ongoing care.
Canine Periodic Pet Examinations:
During a canine periodic medical examination, we perform a thorough
physical examination, including:

#2 Shower & Grooming Services
Maintaining your pet's hygiene and appearance contributes significantly to their overall
health, comfort, and well-being. At Dr. Paws, we offer a range of gentle and effective pet
clean up services, designed to keep your pet looking and feeling their best. These pet
clean up services, while not strictly medical, are an important part of preventative care
and complement our other veterinary services:
● Nail Clipping: Regular nail trims are essential for preventing overgrowth, which
can cause painful discomfort, difficulty walking, and even joint problems. We
offer nail trimming for dogs, cats, and birds, using techniques that minimize
stress and ensure a comfortable experience.
● Ear Cleaning: Clean ears are healthy ears! Our gentle ear cleaning service
helps prevent infections, removes wax buildup, and keeps your pet comfortable.
This service is available for dogs and cats and is especially beneficial for
breeds prone to ear problems.
● Bath and Drying: We offer soothing bath and drying services using
high-quality, pet-safe shampoos and conditioners. This service helps remove
dirt, debris, and odors, leaving your pet's coat clean, soft, and healthy. This
service is primarily for dogs and cats and can be tailored to their specific skin
type.
● Hair Combing and Cutting (Grooming): Regular grooming, including combing
and haircuts, is essential for maintaining a healthy and manageable coat. Our

#3 Diagnostic Tests
Accurate and timely diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. At Dr. Paws, we offer a
comprehensive range of diagnostic veterinary services to quickly and accurately assess
your pet's health. Our state-of-the-art facility is equipped with advanced diagnostic
technology, allowing us to perform a variety of tests, including:
● Laboratory Testing:
○ Chemical Blood Tests: These tests evaluate organ function (liver,
kidneys, pancreas), electrolyte balance, and other important blood
parameters.
○ Complete Blood Count (CBC): A CBC provides information about
red and white blood cells, platelets, and other blood components,
helping diagnose infections, anemia, and other blood disorders.
○ Urine Analysis: This test assesses kidney function, detects urinary
tract infections, and identifies other urinary system abnormalities.
○ Intestinal Parasite Examinations: Microscopic examination of fecal
samples to detect and identify intestinal parasites.
○ Fungal Disease Examinations: Various tests, including microscopic
examination and cultures, to diagnose fungal infections.
○ Viral Disease Examinations: Utilizing various diagnostic methods to
detect viral infections.
● Imaging:
○ X-rays (Radiography): Providing detailed images of bones, joints,
and internal organs.
○ Dental X-rays: Specifically used to assess the health of teeth and
surrounding bone structures.
○ Ultrasound: Using sound waves to create real-time images of internal
organs, allowing for detailed evaluation of their structure and function.
● Advanced Diagnostics:
○ Microscopic Examination: Examining samples (e.g., blood, tissue,
urine) under a microscope to identify cells, bacteria, parasites, or other
abnormalities.
○ Internal and External Endoscopy: Using a small camera attached to
a flexible tube to visualize the inside of organs or body cavities.
These comprehensive diagnostic veterinary services enable our veterinarians to pinpoint
the cause of your pet's illness or injury and develop a precise and effective treatment
plan.

#4 Medical Surgeries
At Dr. Paws, our experienced veterinarians perform a wide range of medical surgeries
using the latest techniques and state-of-the-art equipment. We understand that pet
surgery can be a stressful time for both pets and their owners, and we are committed to
providing a safe, comfortable, and supportive environment throughout the entire process.
Our comprehensive pet surgery services include:
● Sterilization Operations (Spay/Neuter): These routine procedures,
ovariohysterectomy (spay) for females and castration (neuter) for males,
prevent unwanted litters and offer numerous health benefits, including reducing
the risk of certain cancers and behavioral problems.
● Orthopedic surgery for pets: We address a variety of bone and joint
conditions, including fractures, ligament tears (such as cruciate ligament
ruptures), hip and elbow dysplasia, and other orthopedic issues. Our orthopedic
veterinary services aim to restore mobility and improve your pet's quality of life.
● Digestive System Operations: Our surgeons are experienced in treating
conditions affecting the stomach, intestines, liver, pancreas, and other digestive
organs. These procedures may include foreign body removal, biopsies, and
treatment of conditions like bloat (gastric dilatation-volvulus).
● Rhinoplasty (for Brachycephalic Breeds): Specifically designed for
brachycephalic (short-nosed) breeds like Bulldogs, Pugs, and Boxers, this
procedure widens the congenitally narrow nostrils to significantly improve
breathing and alleviate brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome (BOAS).
● Urinary Tract Operations: We address a range of urinary tract conditions,
including bladder stones, urinary obstructions, and other urinary system issues.
These procedures aim to restore normal urinary function and alleviate
discomfort.
Prior to any pet surgery procedure, we conduct a thorough pre-surgical evaluation,
including a physical exam, blood work, and other necessary tests, to ensure your pet is a
good candidate for surgery. We thoroughly discuss the procedure, potential risks, and
post-operative care instructions with you. We prioritize pain management throughout the
surgical process and provide comprehensive post-operative care to ensure a smooth
and comfortable recovery. These surgical veterinary services are a vital part of our
commitment to providing complete and compassionate care for your pet.

#5 Dental Services
Good oral hygiene is crucial for your pet's overall health and well-being. Dr. Paws offers
comprehensive dental veterinary services designed to keep your pet's teeth and gums
healthy throughout their lives. Our services include:
● Professional Teeth Cleaning (Prophylaxis): This is the cornerstone of
preventative dental care. During a professional cleaning, we remove plaque
and tartar buildup from above and below the gum line using specialized
instruments. This process helps prevent periodontal disease, a serious
condition that can lead to tooth loss, pain, and even organ damage. We also
polish the teeth to create a smooth surface that is less susceptible to plaque
accumulation.
● Comprehensive Dental Check-ups (Oral Examinations): Regular dental
check-ups are essential for early detection of dental problems. During these
examinations, our veterinarians thoroughly assess your pet's oral health,
checking for signs of gum disease, tooth decay, oral tumors, and other
abnormalities. We may also recommend dental X-rays to evaluate the health of
the tooth roots and surrounding bone.
● Scaling and Root Planing: Scaling removes tartar buildup from the tooth
surface, both above and below the gum line. Root planing smooths the tooth
root surfaces, making it more difficult for plaque to adhere. This procedure is
particularly important for treating periodontal disease and preventing further
damage to the gums and supporting bone.
● Tooth Extractions: In cases of severe dental disease, such as advanced
periodontal disease or fractured teeth, extraction may be necessary. Our
veterinarians perform extractions with careful attention to pain management
and patient comfort.
● Oral Surgery: For more complex dental issues, such as oral tumors or jaw
fractures, we offer advanced oral surgery procedures.
Regular dental care, including professional cleanings and home care, is essential for
preventing periodontal disease, which can lead to serious health problems affecting the
heart, kidneys, and other organs. Our dental veterinary services are designed to
maintain your pet's oral health, improve their quality of life, and contribute to their overall
well-being.

#6 Periodic Vaccinations
Pet vaccinations are a cornerstone of preventative veterinary services, protecting your
pet from a range of contagious and potentially life-threatening diseases. At Dr. Paws, we
understand that every pet is unique, so we tailor our pet vaccinations protocols based on
your pet's species, age, lifestyle, and individual risk factors.
Trivalent and Quadrivalent Cat Vaccines
Trivalent and quadrivalent vaccines are among the most important vaccines that cats
must receive to protect them from a group of serious viral diseases. The trivalent vaccine
provides protection against three diseases:
● Feline Herpesvirus: Causes upper respiratory tract infections in cats, which
can lead to serious health problems.
● Calicivirus: Also causes upper respiratory tract infections, and can cause
chronic respiratory problems.
● Panleukopenia: Also known as feline distemper, it is a highly contagious viral
disease that affects the digestive system, causing diarrhea, vomiting,
dehydration, and can be fatal.
The quadrivalent vaccine adds protection against Feline Leukemia, a cancer that affects
the cat's immune system.
Benefits of Trivalent and Quadrivalent Vaccines:
● Protection from fatal diseases: These vaccines protect cats from potentially
fatal diseases or diseases that can cause serious health complications.
● Strengthening the immune system: These vaccines help strengthen the cat's
immune system, making it more resistant to diseases.
● Preventing the spread of diseases: These vaccines help prevent the spread
of diseases among other cats.
Canine Pentavalent Vaccine
The pentavalent vaccine is one of the most important vaccines that dogs must receive to
protect them from a group of serious viral and bacterial diseases. The pentavalent
vaccine provides protection against five diseases:
● Rabies: A serious viral disease that affects the nervous system and leads to
death.
● Parvovirus: A highly contagious viral disease that affects the digestive system,
causing diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and can be fatal.
● Adenovirus: Causes inflammation of the respiratory and digestive systems.
● Parainfluenza: Causes inflammation of the respiratory system.
● Bordetella: Causes inflammation of the respiratory system.
Benefits of the Pentavalent Vaccine:
● Protection from fatal diseases: This vaccine protects dogs from potentially
fatal diseases or diseases that can cause serious health complications.
● Strengthening the immune system: This vaccine helps strengthen the dog's
immune system, making it more resistant to diseases.
● Preventing the spread of diseases: This vaccine helps prevent the spread of
diseases among other dogs.
Rabies Vaccine
The rabies vaccine is one of the most important vaccines that both dogs and cats must
receive. This vaccine protects against rabies, a viral disease that affects the nervous
system and leads to death. Rabies can be transmitted to humans through the bite of an
infected animal, so vaccinating pets is an important way to prevent the spread of this
disease.
Deworming Medications
Deworming medications are not exactly vaccines, but rather medications used to
eliminate intestinal worms that can infect pets. These medications should be given
periodically as directed by the veterinarian, especially for pets that go outdoors or come
into contact with other animals.
Our veterinary services team will discuss the appropriate pet vaccinations and
deworming schedule for your pet and answer any questions you may have. These
preventative veterinary services play a key role in maintaining your pet's health and
preventing the spread of infectious diseases.

Pet Travel Procedures
Traveling with your pet can be a rewarding experience, but it requires careful planning
and adherence to specific regulations. Dr. Paws offers comprehensive pet travel
procedures services to ensure smooth and safe pet travel, both domestically and
internationally. We understand that each destination has unique requirements, and our
experienced team is here to guide you through the process. Our pet travel veterinary
services include:
● Health Certificates: A health certificate is an official document issued by a
licensed veterinarian, verifying that your pet is healthy and free from contagious
diseases. This certificate is often required for travel across state lines or
internationally. We will perform a thorough physical examination of your pet to
ensure they meet the necessary health standards. The specific requirements
for health certificates vary by destination, so it's crucial to contact us well in
advance of your travel dates.
● Rabies Testing for Travel Purposes: Rabies is a serious viral disease, and
many countries require proof of rabies vaccination and/or a rabies titer test for
entry. A rabies titer test measures the level of rabies antibodies in your pet's
blood, confirming adequate immunity. Our veterinary services include
administering rabies vaccinations (if needed) and performing the rabies titer
test. We will provide you with the official documentation required for
international travel, ensuring it meets the specific requirements of your
destination country. Please note that there are often waiting periods after
vaccination or testing before travel is permitted.
● Filling out Certificate Forms: The paperwork for international pet travel can
be complex and confusing, with different countries having different forms and
requirements. Our experienced team can assist you in completing the
necessary certificate forms accurately and efficiently. We stay up-to-date on the
latest regulations for various destinations, including European countries and
those requiring specific endorsed certificates from the USDA APHIS (United
States Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service).
We'll ensure all forms are properly filled out and endorsed, minimizing the risk
of delays or complications during your travels.
These veterinary services for pet travel procedures are designed to make the process
as stress-free as possible for both you and your pet. We recommend contacting us
several weeks or even months before your planned travel date to allow ample time for
necessary examinations, testing, and paperwork.
